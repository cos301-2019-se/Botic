\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Agile Unified Methodology}

<Provide a Diagram of the AUM>

Using the Agile Unified Methodology to take advantage of agile principles as well as work with a methodology based off the
waterfall process, that has a simple linear and uncomplicated progression is what we have chosen to do. We anticipate that
the project will not have a high requirements change throughout development, and this makes the waterfall process derivative
methodology more fitting.

The Agile Unified Methodology makes use of Test-Driven Development, which is a sure-in for high quality code development.
<Provide details of how we would deal with the set backs of the Test-Driven Development>
<Additional motivations>

At the moment, phase 3 has high priority.

\section{Planning Phase}

Planning Phase: Succeeded.
 - First meeting with client
 - Use Case-iteration allocation matrix here.

\section{Iterative Phase}
 Interative Phase:
- All artifacts are listed and the changes can be checked out by cross referencing appropriate artifacts.
- Each phase should logically include changes to all the implementation documentation.

\subsection{Phase 1:}
 - Demo 1 happened here.
 - Phase 2 artifacts to be listed here.

\subsubsection{Accomodating Requirements Change}
 
\subsubsection{Domain Modeling}
 
\subsubsection{Actor-System Iteraction Modeling & User Interface Design}
 
\subsubsection{Behavior Modeling & Responsibility Assignment}
 
\subsubsection{Deriving Design Class Diagram}
 
\subsubsection{Test-Driven Development}
 
\subsubsection{Integration}
 
\subsubsection{Deployment}

\subsection{Phase 2:} 
 - Demo 2 happened here
 - Phase 2 artifacts to be listed here.

\subsubsection{Accomodating Requirements Change}
 
\subsubsection{Domain Modeling}
  
\subsubsection{Actor-System Iteraction Modeling & User Interface Design}
  
\subsubsection{Behavior Modeling & Responsibility Assignment}
  
\subsubsection{Deriving Design Class Diagram}
  
\subsubsection{Test-Driven Development}
  
\subsubsection{Integration}
  
\subsubsection{Deployment}

\subsection{Phase 3:}

\subsubsection{Accomodating Requirements Change}
- Another meeting with clients.
- Refined the requirements according to proper rules thus we must refine the use cases. Link to the new SRS.
- Updated architectural desgin.
- Link the updated specific requirement and the use cases.
- List of use cases to implementated (before and after)

P: Iteration Use Cases
- Haven't produce new ones out of necessity.
- Placing emphasis on the Chatbot component that is meant to use all subsystem.
- Using updated Architecture

\subsubsection{Domain Modeling}
- Domain Model has been updated.

\subsubsection{Actor-System Iteraction Modeling & User Interface Design}

\subsubsection{Behavior Modeling & Responsibility Assignment}

\subsubsection{Deriving Design Class Diagram}

\subsubsection{Test-Driven Development}

\subsubsection{Integration}

\subsubsection{Deployment}
